<p><em>In 1996 the United States federal government passed Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, commonly referred to as "HIPAA". Although HIPAA has been "on the books" for several years, it's only been since the passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2008 that the Department of Health and Human Services (HSS) was given the teeth to enforce the laws. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act portion of ARRA contains the body of laws that encompass the guidelines for Meaningful Use. Subtitle D of the HITECH Act addresses the privacy and security concerns associated with electronic protected health information (PHI).
<br><br><span class="dropcap2">1</span>Since its passage, the medical community has been focused on the Meaningful Use portion of HITECH, while Subtitle D has been, for the most part, overlooked. Complying with these new requirements is a component of HIPAA, and, as such, is as important to your Meaningful Use qualification as the EMR providers have begun using.
<br><br><span class="dropcap2">2</span>Effective February 18, 2009, penalties for security violations was increased from a maximum amount of $25,000 to a maximum amount of $1,500,000. Additionally, "covered entities" can no longer bar the imposition of a civil money penalties. In other words, HSS has the last word on what a breach will cost you.
<br><br><span class="dropcap2">3</span>Within HHS, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) is responsible for the detection and enforcement of HIPAA. Several million dollars of additional funding has been provided to HSS to enable OCR to increase staffing and create a privacy advisor in each of OCR's 10 regional offices. They've staffed up to enforce the new privacy laws, are you prepared?
<br><br><span class="dropcap2">4</span>Medical professionals have already been imprisoned for violating HIPAA rules, including a Cardiologist in Los Angeles. It&#39;s no longer adviseable to simply do the minimum to meet these requirements.
<br><br><span class="dropcap2">5</span>Achieving HIPAA Compliance can be accomplished with a great deal of effort, time, and expense.
